- 👋 HELLO, I’m Brahvim, but only for WhtHtJr..
- 👀 I’m interested in ...absolutely nothing, this is not my main account!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...p5.js, ":D! And some... Matter.js(In the future..?), with a ~~bad and BROKEN~~ library called p5.play ~~, and not just whatever **~~the heck~~** I am being taught.~~
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...absolutely ~~WHATever~~ whatever I am told to work on, I guess!
- 📫 How to reach me ...via my [main account](https://github.com/Brahvim) I guess..?
